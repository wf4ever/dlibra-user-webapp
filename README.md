dLibra User Management Service
==============================

This service has been merged with the RO Portal since RO Portal version 3, and is now *obsolete*.

This is the RODL User Management Service. It allows users to create workspaces in dLibra 
and grant access to it to other Wf4Ever applications. Additionally, it contains a wizard for
importing files, workflows and packs from users' accounts in http://www.myexperiment.org.
