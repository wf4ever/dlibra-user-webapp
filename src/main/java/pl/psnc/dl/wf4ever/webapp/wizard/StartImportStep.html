				wicket:id="filesCnt">0</span> files have been found in your
			myExperiment account.
		</p>
		<p>This wizard allows you to copy your resources
			(workflows/files/packs) from myExperiment to dLibra, aggregating them
			as Research Objects (RO). The wizard will help you to select how you
			want to aggregate these resources.</p>
		<p>Since the actual structure of RO and its metadata is still
			under development, for every imported resource its accompanying RDF
			file will also be transfered to make sure that the metadata will be
			available for processing in the future.</p>
		<p>The wizard has the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Select resources. Choose if you want to import all resources
				as 1 RO <strong>or</strong> every resource as a separate RO.
			</li>
			<li>Choose RO names.</li>
			<li><i>Go back to step 1 if you want to define more ROs.</i></li>
			<li>Create ROs in dLibra, copy selected resources from
				myExperiment to dLibra.</li>
			<li>Summary.</li>
